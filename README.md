# Sudoku
A small sudoku game and solver! (there's only one level because I'm lazy... there's a few more in the code and feel free to find more yourself :D)

### Running the game
All you have to do is download the .exe file! (if you're on mac I'm sorry I don't know how that works :D). You can also download the python file and run that (you can add levels/grids for yourself that way!)

### Some notes
- Click on a box to select it, after you select it, you can enter numbers in it
- You can change the selected box by using the arrow keys
- Pressing space + number will register the number as a guess
- Pressing enter will get the program to solve the grid for you
- Pressing x will toggle the auto-checker/auto-corrector on and off
